# Hi, Iâ€™m Rebecca ðŸ‘‹
***

Welcome to my profile! I'm a passionate data analyst with a keen interest in translating complex data into compelling stories.

ðŸŒ± I officially embarked on my data journey in July 2023 and have been exploring the wonderful world of Python, SQL and Tableau ever since.

Iâ€™m always looking to learn, so if you want to collaborate on data-driven stories and interactive data visualisations you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-chu-2103/).
